      Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives
      you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without
      any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

      Every Tailwind utility also comes with responsive variants, making it
      extremely easy to build responsive interfaces without resorting to custom
      CSS. Tailwind uses an intuitive screen: prefix that makes it easy to
      notice responsive classes in your markup while keeping the original class
      name recognizable and intact.

      While you can do a lot with just utility classes, as a project grows it
      can be useful to codify common patterns into higher level abstractions.

      Tailwind provides tools for extracting component classes from repeated
      utility patterns, making it easy to update multiple instances of a
      component from one place.

      If it makes sense to be customizable, Tailwind lets you customize it. This
      includes colors, border sizes, font weights, spacing utilities,
      breakpoints, shadows, and tons more.

      Tailwind is written in PostCSS and configured in JavaScript, which means
      you have the full power of a real programming language at your fingertips.

      systems.
