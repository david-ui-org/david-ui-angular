## Installation

To get started with David UI Angular, simply install it via npm or yarn.

```bash
  npm install david-ui-angular
```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate David UI Angular into your Angular project:

1. Import the styles: In your project's styles.css or styles.scss, import David UI Angular's styles along with Tailwind CSS and you also need to import the **@angular/cdk** styles:


```css
@import "<path-to-node_modules>/david-ui-angular/styles/_styles.scss";
@import "@angular/cdk/overlay-prebuilt.css";
```

OR
You can add the link of style sheet in your angular.json style's list
```angular.json
"styles": [
              "src/styles.scss",
              "./node_modules/david-ui-angular/styles/_styles.scss"
            ],
```

2. Import the david-ui-angular modules into your app.module.ts file
```javascript
import { DUIButton } from "david-ui-angular";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, DUIButton],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

then you can import and use the component in your html file like shown below.

```html
<dui-button>Click Me</dui-button>
```
3. After this you need to add below line into the content array of you tailwind.config.js file

```tailwing.config
"./node_modules/david-ui-angular/**/*.{html,ts,js,mjs}"
```
